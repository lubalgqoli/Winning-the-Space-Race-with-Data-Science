IBM Data Science Capstone Project:

How predictable is a SpaceX landing: As the finale of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, this project centers on forecasting on the end to end machine learning framework to analyse and predict the success of Falcon 9 first-stage recoveries. I developed a comprehensive data lifecycle, leveraging REST API for data collection and training predictive models to identify the variables that determine a successful landing mission. I uncovered the critical flight parameters that drive rocket reusability, providing a data driven perspective on the variables that make aerospace cost-efficiency possible.
